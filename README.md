## Why this Project?

Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development". This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.

Whether you work in an organization that uses test-driven development or in an organization that uses tests to make sure future feature development doesn't break existing features, it's an important skill to have!


## What will I learn?

You will learn how to use Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application. These will test the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.

## Steps required to successfully test the application

To successfully run the application follow the below steps:

* open command prompt or terminal.
* cd <directory_name> //where u want to save the Project
* go to https://github.com/goodgoof/Feedreader-testing page click on the clone or download green button.
* clone the repo on your terminal using command
`git clone git@github.com:goodgoof/Feedreader-testing.git`
* go to the cloned repo in your directory using cmd `cd`
* open index.html in your browser.
